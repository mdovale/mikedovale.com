description: "This gallery is dedicated to the memory of the three men who lost their lives in the waters of Orzán beach, A Coruña (Spain), in January 2012. In an act of valor and solidarity, three police officers entered the sea to save a drowning visiting student. None of them returned. The photographs trace the form and presence of the monument erected in their honor, which stands as a quiet witness to their sacrifice. The curves, edges, shadows, and light captured here reflect the depth of human bravery. This is not a tribute to a structure, but a remembrance of lives lost in the service of another. May these images stand in silence, as they do, for the great courage of those who did not hesitate."
