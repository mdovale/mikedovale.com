## My Story

My journey with photography began in 2005 when a fellow photographer and friend gifted me a [HP PhotoSmart 945 5.3MP](https://www.dpreview.com/articles/1031762179/hp945). Over the last 20 years, photography has been a constant and extremely fulfilling adventure.

## Beyond the Lens

Outside photography, I am also a physicist and engineer. You can check my trajectory at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-dovale/).

When I’m not behind the camera, or creating memories with my wife, I enjoy continuously learning — both in science and in photography.
